**Rust-powered embedded calculator with joystick interface**

A minimalist calculator OS for Arduino Nano that uses single LED (or vibromotor for feedback, but this in future) and joystick for navigation. Perfect for embedded projects like this, educational purposes, or just a unique computing experience.

## Features:
- ü¶Ä Rust for embedded safety
- üî¢ Fixed-point arithmetic engine with rounding (supports numbers up to 2^64)
- üßÆ Basic operations (+, -, √ó, √∑) and advanced functions (‚àö, x¬≤)
- üïπÔ∏è Joystick-based navigation through virtual keyboard
- üí° LED-based numeric output display via blink patterns

## Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino Nano (New Bootloader)
- Joystick module HW-504 (VRx, VRy, SW)
- LED indicator
- Maybe serial connection for debugging
- And maybe more in future

## Usage:
Calculator control is intuitive:
- On power-on, the cursor is on the digit 5 of the virtual keyboard
- Moving the joystick changes the cursor position
- Pressing the joystick activates the current key
- After pressing, the cursor returns to the starting position (digit 5)

Virtual keyboard layout:
                  Constants
                      |
                      œÄ
                  ‚àö 7 8 9 √∑
Unary operators ‚Äî x¬≤4 5 6 √ó ‚Äî Binary operators
                    1 2 3 +
                    . 0 = -
                      |
             Advanced functions

Key types:
- Digits - input numbers
- Dot - enables fractional input mode
- Equals - gives the result of a binary operation
- Constants - insert constants (in development)
- Advanced functions - varies

Advanced functions may include equation solving using neural networks, photomath, or remembering results of previous calculations, etc.

A more specific layout is defined in the code (configuration will be improved in the future).


## Build Instructions
1. Install prerequisites as described in the [`avr-hal` README] (`avr-gcc`, `avr-libc`, `avrdude`, [`ravedude`]).

2. Run `cargo build` to build the firmware.

3. Run `cargo run` to flash the firmware to a connected board.  If `ravedude`
   fails to detect your board, check its documentation at
   <https://crates.io/crates/ravedude>.

4. `ravedude` will open a console session after flashing where you can interact
   with the UART console of your board.
