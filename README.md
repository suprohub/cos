**Rust-powered embedded calculator with joystick interface**

A minimalistic calculator OS for Arduino Nano, using a single vibration motor and a joystick for navigation. Ideal for people with disabilities, educational purposes, or just a unique computing experience.

## Features:
- ü¶Ä Rust for comfort development and embedded safety
- üî¢ Fixed-point arithmetic engine with rounding (supports numbers up to 2^64)
- üßÆ Basic operations (+, -, √ó, √∑) and advanced functions (‚àö, x¬≤)
- üïπÔ∏è Joystick-based navigation through virtual keyboard
- üì≥ Vibromotor-based numeric output display via blink patterns

**Why is the joystick selected?**
- Upgrade convenience: changing the behavior of the interface (keyboard layout, navigation logic) is implemented in the firmware ‚Äî no need to reassemble the electronics, just the firmware.
- Compact: The joystick combines multiple directions and a button in one small component, which reduces size and simplifies installation.

## Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino Nano (New Bootloader)
- Joystick module HW-504 (VRx, VRy, SW)
- Vibromotor
- Maybe serial connection for debugging
- And maybe more in future

## Usage:
Calculator control is intuitive:
- On power-on, the cursor is on the digit 5 of the virtual keyboard
- Moving the joystick changes the cursor position
- Pressing the joystick activates the current key
- After pressing, the cursor returns to the starting position (digit 5)

Virtual keyboard layout:
```
                  Constants
                      |
                  œÑ Œ≥ œÄ e œÜ ‚àö2
                  ‚àö 7 8 9 √∑
Unary operators ‚Äî - 4 5 6 √ó ‚Äî Binary operators
                  x¬≤1 2 3 +
                    . 0 = -
                      |
             Advanced functions
```

Key types:
- Digits - input numbers
- Dot - enables fractional input mode
- Equals - gives the result of a binary operation
- Constants - insert constants (in development)
- Advanced functions - varies

Advanced functions may include equation solving using neural networks, photomath, or remembering results of previous calculations, etc.

A more specific layout is defined in the code (configuration will be improved in the future).


## Build Instructions
1. Install prerequisites as described in the [`avr-hal` README] (`avr-gcc`, `avr-libc`, `avrdude`, [`ravedude`]).

2. Run `cargo build` to build the firmware.

3. Run `cargo run` to flash the firmware to a connected board.  If `ravedude`
   fails to detect your board, check its documentation at
   <https://crates.io/crates/ravedude>.

4. `ravedude` will open a console session after flashing where you can interact
   with the UART console of your board.
